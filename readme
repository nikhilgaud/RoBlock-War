Steps to follow to use git:

1. Clone the existing repository.
	git clone git@github.com:sumitdorle/630_finalProject.git
   you need to do this only once to get the copy of the repository on your local machine.

2. Nobody should push their changes directly into the master branch. When you start working (implementing) some feature you should create a branch in 630_finalProject
   repo.
   We can merge your changed code from this newly created branch later into master once we make sure it doesnt hamper the already implemented functionality in       
   master branch.

   How to create a branch:  
   	git checkout -b test_branch  
   (This should create a branch locally.)

   The remote branch is automatically created when you push it to the remote server. So when you feel ready for it, you can just do:
   	git push origin test_branch

3. To switch between branches
	git checkout branch_name

4. To get latest code from branch (we should specify from which remote branch we want to pull project code)
	git pull origin branch_name

5. To commit and push your code on your created branch
	-make sure you checkout correct branch (i.e. by doing git checkout)
	git add . (will add all the changes)
	git commit -am "commeting on the changes"
	git push origin branch_name  (this will push your code on your newly created branch and not on master)

6. click on branches link on your github page and create a pull request asking to merge your code in master.
	base branch will be your branch
	source branch should be master
